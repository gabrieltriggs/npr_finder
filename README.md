Old one-day project for learning a few iOS concepts.

Simple iOS app for quickly finding nearby NPR stations.

Note: Requires the addition of an APIKey.plist with 1 item with name 
"APIKey," type String, and, as its value, a private API key for NPR's
API. To obtain this, visit www.npr.org/api/index.php.
